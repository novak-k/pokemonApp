This app was created with React and Vite, on Typescript, using the [Mantine library](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/). 
Data was retrieved from [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co).

The main page is divided into several components, that are connected to each other and to App.tsx via "props", making it easy to maintain and change separate parts. 
Action such as a search available via Redux.
